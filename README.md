- The -i indicator tells what input file to use. Either input1.txt or input2.txt (omit {} brackets)
- The -s indicator tells what type of scheduling you want. Either EDF or RM (omit {} brackets)
- The -e indicator set a flag that tells the code to run the energy efficient algorithm
    - Omit this if you do not want to run energy efficient
